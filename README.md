# CryptoClustering

## Project Overview
This is the Crypto Cluster Project.  In this project, we will use our knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to determine how price changes over a specific time period affect cryptocurrencies.

## Project Goals

We will pull the data from the crypto market data CSV by reading it into a dataframe with Pandas.  From there, we will transform, fit and analyze our data using the elbow method as well as Principal Component Analysis.  In the first part, the elbow dataframe we create using scaled data will be used to plot a line chart to determine the ideal KMeans value and also a cluster scatter plot.  In the second part, we will use PCA to create the elbow line and cluster scatter plots.
